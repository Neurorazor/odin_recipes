        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 375Â°F.</li>
          <li>Pound the chicken breasts until they are evenly thick, about 1/2 inch.</li>
          <li>Season the flour with salt and pepper. Coat the chicken in the seasoned flour, then dip in the beaten eggs, and finally coat in the breadcrumb and Parmesan mixture.</li>
          <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken until golden brown on both sides, about 3-4 minutes per side.</li>
          <li>Spread a layer of tomato sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Place the cooked chicken in the dish and top with more sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
          <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the chicken is cooked through.</li>
          <li>Serve hot with your favorite side dish.</li>
